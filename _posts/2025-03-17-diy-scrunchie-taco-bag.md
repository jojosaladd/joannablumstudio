Learn how to make a Scrunchie Taco Bag with a free sewing pattern! Perfect for beginners and a great DIY project for spring. 🌸👜

Hello, everyone! This is my first FREE pattern of 2025—the **Scrunchie Taco Bag!** 👜  

I’ve recently become a mini purse person! I used to love big totes, but after a shoulder injury, I can no longer carry heavy handbags on one side (Am I getting old? 😅). 
Since spring is here, I think this scrunchie-strap, half-circle "taco bag" is a perfect DIY project for the season! 🌸🌿  

I hope you enjoy this fun and easy sewing project! 

Let's get started! Here is the free pattern for your own Scrunchie Taco Bag 💕

#### Patten Piece Inventory:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/pattern_layout.png" alt="pattern_inventory" style="width:450px;">

- **A**: Main Body – **Self** (Cut 2 on Fold) & **Lining** (Cut 2 on Fold)  
- **B**: Lining Pocket – **Lining** (Cut 1 on Fold) *(Optional)*  
- **C**: Outer Strap – **Self** (Cut 1 on Fold)  
- **D**: Bottom Panel – **Self** (Cut 1 on Fold) & **Lining** (Cut 1 on Fold)  
- **E**: Inner Strap – **Self** or **Lining** (Cut 1 on Fold) *(Optional)*  

##### ℹ️ Inner Strap (Piece E) - Elastic vs. Fabric  
- If you choose to use **elastic** instead of fabric for the inner strap, you **do not** need to cut piece E. Instead, you will need **1"(25mm) or 7/8"(22mm) wide elastic**.  
- If you use **fabric** for the inner strap:  
  - **Thin fabric?** Consider adding **interfacing** for stability.  
  - **Thick fabric?** You might prefer using **lining fabric** instead of self-fabric to avoid bulk.  

Choose the best option based on your fabric type and preference! 😊  

#### Fabric Requirements

- **Main Body Dimensions:** **8" (20 cm) wide × 5" (13 cm) high**  
- This project requires **less than 1 yard (1 meter) of fabric**, making it a great scrap-busting project! ♻️  
- **Outer Strap Consideration:** If you want to avoid fabric waste, you can cut the strap in multiple shorter pieces and sew them together instead of using a single long piece.  


## Gather Your Materials:
- Your choice of self fabric
- Your choice of lining fabric 
- Fabric marking pen or pencil
- Sewing clips or pins
- Sewing machine, needle, coordinating thread
- Tools for hand stitching
- (OPTIONAL) [Sew-In Magnetic Snap Buttons](https://amzn.to/435aVO5) 
- (OPTIONAL) [1 Inch Knit Elastic](https://amzn.to/3Fu6Xqs)

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/3.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:400px;">

6. Place the pocket on the desired area and edge-stitch around it to secure.  
7. Sew a divider line down the center of the pocket to create separate sections.  
8. Mark the placement for the snap buttons.  
9. Hand-sew the snap buttons securely.

##### **Step 1: Prepare the Strap**  

**Inner Strap**  
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/4.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:400px;">

1. Sew the **inner strap (E)** right sides together using a **1/2" (1.3 cm)** seam allowance. Consdier adding interfacing if the fabric is too thin.
2. Trim the seam allowance, then flip the strap right side out using a loop turner or paperclip.  
3. Press the strap flat.  
4. *(If using elastic): Skip 1-3, simply cut the elastic to your desired length. **Suggested length: 13-14"(33 to 35.5 cm) + seam allowance**  

**Outer Strap**  
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/5.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:400px;">

1. Sew the **outer strap (C)** right sides together with a **1/2" (1.3 cm)** seam allowance.  
2. Trim the seam allowance, then flip the strap right side out using a loop turner or paperclip.  
  
**Strap Assembly**  
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/6.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:400px;">

1. Feed the inner strap or elastic **through the casing of the outer strap**.
2. Adjust the ruching evenly or as desired.  
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/7.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:400px;">
3. Secure the ends with an overlock stitch or zigzag stitch.

##### **Step 2: Assemble the Body**  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/8.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:300px;">

1. Sew the bottom edge of one **self main body piece (A)** to the **self bottom panel (D)** with a **1/2" (1.3 cm)** seam allowance.  
   *Tip: Clip notches on piece D and align them to A to help ease the curve while sewing.*  

2. Repeat this step for the other side.  
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/9.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:300px;">
3. Optionally (but highly recommended), **topstitch** along the bottom panel seam.  
4. Repeat the same steps for the **lining main body (A)** and **lining bottom panel (D)**.

##### **Step 3: Assemble Everything Together**  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/10.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:300px;">

1. Place the **strap** at the **top edge of the bottom panel (self side)** and **sew securely at 1/4" (0.6 cm)**.  
   *The handle should be pointing downwards towards the bottom of the A-front piece.*  
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/11.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:200px;">

2. Insert the **lining piece** inside the **self piece**, **right sides together**. Align the side seams.  
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/12.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:200px;">

3. Pin everything in place. **Be sure to leave a 3" (7.6 cm) opening for turning the bag**, preferably at the **center back (CB)** area.  
4. Using a **1/2" (1.3 cm)** seam allowance, stitch around the top edge of the bag.  
5. Turn your bag right side out through the opening and carefully press the top seam.
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post31/13.png" alt="scrunchie_bag_instruction" style="width:200px;">

6. Optionally, **topstitch** around the entire top edge of the bag **or** close the opening using a **ladder stitch**.
