Experience the joy of sewing your own chic ruffled off-the-shoulder top with our **FREE pattern** and beginner-friendly instructions!

Our third free pattern for this spring is this lovely ruffled off-shoulder top! This can be a fantastic project for confident beginners eager to learn how to utilize elastics. ðŸ’•

You'll need 1/4" (6-7mm) elastic for this project; here's the [link](https://amzn.to/3y0bsFC) to the one I used.

##### ðŸ’• Learn How to Only Print Your Size:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post20/printing.png" alt="emma-ruffle-mini-skirt-printing-example" style="width:550px;">

This pattern file has embedded layers (organized by size). If you don't want to print all sizes, you can choose to print only your size using Adobe Reader (FREE!):

1. Open in [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)
2. Menu -> View -> Show/Hide -> Side Panels -> Make sure **Layers** is checked.
3. Click on the **Layers** option on the side panel.
4. There will be an eye next to each layer in the pattern. Turn off (by clicking) all the layers you do not need. The **DO NOT TOUCH** layer needs to remain on for all sizes.
