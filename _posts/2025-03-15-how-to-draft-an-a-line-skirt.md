Learn how to draft an A-line skirt from a skirt sloper using the slash and spread method. ü§©‚≠ê

Hello everyone!  

So sorry for not posting for a while‚ÄîI can‚Äôt believe this is my first post of 2025! My life has been really hectic as I adjust to grad student life, but I‚Äôm back! üéâ  

The good news is that I‚Äôve saved tons of blog post ideas, and hopefully, I can write a post at least once or twice a month.  

Today, I‚Äôll be sharing **how to draft a basic A-line flared skirt from a skirt sloper.** ‚ú® This is one of the most common beginner-friendly pattern-making projects, and I hope this post helps you!

#### Overview: What is an A-line skirt?

An A-line skirt is fitted at the waist and gradually flares out toward the hem, forming an "A" shape. In other words, the hemline is wider than the hip circumference. It's a versatile design that works well for many body types and can be made in mini, knee-length, midi, or any length variation.  

Depending on the design, you can create a true A-line skirt with a subtle flare or a more flared version with extra sweep along the hemline for added movement and volume.


### How to Draft an A-line skirt
##### Decide on the Skirt Length

Before drafting, determine how long you want your A-line skirt to be. Here are some general guidelines:  

- Mini (Above the knee): 17-19 inches (43-48 cm) from the waist  
- On-Knee Length: 20-23 inches (51-58 cm)  
- Midi Length: 24-28 inches (61-71 cm)  
- Tea Length (Mid-calf): 29-34 inches (74-86 cm)  

Tip: If you‚Äôre unsure, measure a skirt you already own and like the length of!

##### Trace and Adjust Your Skirt Sloper  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post30/1.png" alt="adjust_skirt_length" style="width:500px;">

1. **Trace your front and back skirt sloper** onto pattern paper.  
2. **Adjust the length** by extending or shortening to match your desired skirt length.  
   - Example: If your sloper length (center front top to bottom) is 23 inches (58 cm) and you want a 28-inch (71 cm) skirt, extend it by 5 inches (13 cm).  

##### Apply the Slash and Spread Method  

3. **Draw vertical lines** from the dart points to the hemline, keeping them parallel to the center front and center back.

4. **Cut along these slash lines**, stopping right before the dart points (**DO NOT** cut through them).

5. **Close the darts** by overlapping and taping them shut. This will automatically spread the hemline, creating the A-line shape.  
6. Add **¬Ω inch (1.3 cm) to the side hem** and **blend the hip area smoothly (0" adjustment at the hip).**  
7. **Blend the waistline** if it becomes uneven after closing the darts.  

##### Finalizing the Pattern  

You can now **add a waistband or facing**, depending on your design choice. Don't forget to **add seam allowances** to all edges before cutting your fabric!  

#### Conclusion


Yay, you're done! That wasn‚Äôt so bad, right?  

The slash and spread method is a powerful technique that allows you to control the amount of flare and create a variety of silhouettes. You can also apply this method to add fullness to other patterns, such as pants or tops‚Äîthe possibilities are endless! I hope this guide helps you in your pattern-making journey.
