Learn How to Thread a Juki DDL-9800 Industrial Sewing Machine. 

Hey everyone! After a busy August moving from LA to upstate New York for grad school, I'm back and excited to share something useful. As a TA for an intro fashion design class, I noticed a lack of clear guides for threading **Juki DDL-8700** industrial sewing machines. So, I created this step-by-step tutorial to help my students and fellow sewers.

Whether you're a beginner or a pro, this guide will streamline your sewing setup. Got Questions? Feel free to shoot us an email through the [contact form](https://www.joannablumstudio.com/contact/).
