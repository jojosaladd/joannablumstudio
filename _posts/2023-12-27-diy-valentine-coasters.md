1. On one of the fabric heart pieces, use a fabric marking pen to mark the seam allowance (3/8 inch) on the wrong side, and be sure to mark or clip the notch position.
2. Arrange the pieces in the following order: start with the batting (which doesn't have a right/wrong side), then place the unmarked fabric piece with the wrong side facing the batting. Finally, position the marked fabric (from #1) with the right side facing with the previously stacked pieces.
3. Secure the layers in place by either pinning or clipping before sewing. Also, don't forget to clip the center of the heart this will make sewing the curves easier.

## Step 3: Sewing

1. Sew along the 3/8-inch seam allowance, leaving an opening. This opening will be used later to flip the heart to the right side.
2. After sewing, clip the corner and trim the seam allowance as shown in the picture.
3. Once ready, flip to the right side using the opening. Use a seam creaser or chopstick to make the edges crisp and neat.

4. Press the heart nicely and flat.
5. For the topstitch, mark 1/4 inch using a fabric marking pen on one side and sew when ready.
6. Press again for a smooth finish, and you're done!
