Create an adorable and simple big bow zipper clutch with me. It's the perfect handmade gift! üéÄ

After the overwhelming love for the Melisa Big Bow Tote Bag tutorial, I decided to create a clutch version as part of the adorable Big Bow series. I often found zipper clutches or makeup pouches to be too small, so I made this one a bit larger than the typical designs you see! I hope you enjoy this tutorial, and if you haven't already, be sure to check out the [Melisa Big Bow Tote Bag tutorial](https://www.joannablumstudio.com/diy-melisa-big-bow-tote-bag/).

## Pattern Piece Inventory: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/overview_clutch_pattern.jpg" alt="overview-big-bow-clutch-pattern-pieces" style="width:550px;">


- A: Main& Lining Clutch: Self Cut 2(1 Pair) , Lining Cut 2 (1 Pair)
- B: Main Bow: Self Cut 1
- C: Bow Loop: Self Cut 1
- D: Zipper Facing: Self Cut 2(1 Pair) - OPTIONAL

## Gather Your Materials:

- Your choice of self fabric (My Recommendation: Medium to Heavyweight Fabric such as Duck Canvas)
- Your choice of lining fabric 
- Your choice of 12" zipper (end-to-end measurement should be closer/slightly shorter than 14")
- Fabric marking pen or pencil
- Sewing clips or pins
- Sewing machine, needle, coordinating thread
- Tools for hand stitching

Note: You will need approximately **1/2 to 3/4** inches of fabric, depending on the width of your fabric

## Sewing Instructions:

### (Optional) Part 1: Attaching zipper facing to zipper

1. Fold fabric (D) in half widthwise with the wrong side facing together. Pin or use fabric glue to secure the edges of the zipper, ensuring not to cover the metal components as this can hinder sewing.

2. Topstitch along the folded line of the zipper facing, aligning it with the edges of the zipper.

3. Trim any excess fabric at the ends of the facing. The facing pattern is intentionally longer than necessary to accommodate potential mistakes or adjustments.

### Part 2: Prepare the Bow

1. Fold fabric (B) in half lengthwise with right sides together and stitch along the long edge with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance, ensuring to leave a 3-4 inch gap in the middle.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/4.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-1" style="width:1000px;">

2. Flip the fabric and press well to flatten and refine its appearance.

3. Topstitch or ladder stitch to close the gap.

4. Create 4-5 pleats in the middle using your fingers, then pin them together.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/7.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-4" style="width:500px;">

5. Hand-stitch to secure the pleats in the middle.

6. Fold fabric (C) in half lengthwise with right sides together.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/12.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-9" style="width:800px;">

7. Stitch along the lengthwise part with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/13.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-10" style="width:550px;">

8. Flip it using a spaghetti turner or a similar tool for easy flipping.

### Part 3: Attaching Bow to the Front Clutch

1. Fold fabric (A-front piece) in half and mark the center front (CF). Measure 4 1/2 inches down from the CF and mark the loop placement on the right side of the fabric using an erasable or fabric marker pen.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/9.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-1" style="width:800px;">

2. Overlock only one edge of fabric (C) to prevent it from fraying.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/10.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-2" style="width:500px;">

3. Position one side of fabric (C) with the overlocked side towards the top of (A-front piece) at the marked loop placement. Stitch with a 1/4-inch seam allowance.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/11.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-3" style="width:400px;">


4. Position pieces (B) and (D), determining the space needed for the loop. Ensure it is snug but not overly tight. In my case, I had to trim the loop piece (C) to 3 1/4‚Äù, including a 1/4‚Äù seam allowance for the next step.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/12.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-4" style="width:400px;">

5. After trimming the loop piece, overlock or zigzag the edges to prevent fraying. Hand stitch the bottom loop securely for a strong attachment.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/13.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-5" style="width:800px;">

6. Once the loop is secure, position pieces (B) and (D) into the loop. 

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/14.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-6" style="width:600px;">

7. Lay your bow piece flat and stitch 1/4 inch from the edge on all four sides. Sew 1 inch and pivot, then sew another inch. Ensure neat pivoting for a clean finish.

### Part 4: Sewing the Zipper

**Note:** For Part 4 and 5, I highly recommend this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1AsfZRYlRM) by MADE Everyday.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/16.png" alt="sewing-zipper-picture-1" style="width:600px;">

1. Place one of the lining pieces face up.
2. Lay the zipper on the lining fabric, face up.
3. Now, place the outer fabric piece face down over the zipper.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/17.png" alt="sewing-zipper-picture-2" style="width:900px;">

4. Secure the placement with pins or clips.
5. Sew along the zipper using a zipper foot.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/18.png" alt="sewing-zipper-picture-3" style="width:800px;">

6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the other side of the zipper.
7. Press the seams open, pulling away from the seam. Topstitch if desired.

### Part 5: Sewing the Clutch

1. Ensure the zipper is open.
2. Place the outer pieces right sides together.
3. Place the two lining pieces right sides together.
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/20.png" alt="sewing-zipper-picture-5" style="width:800px;">

4. Clip or pin everything securely, then sew around the edges with a 3/8-inch seam allowance, leaving the lining opening unsewn (3-4 inches). Trim the corners and zipper ends to reduce bulk.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post13/21.png" alt="sewing-zipper-picture-6" style="width:800px;">

#### Part 6: Finishing Up
1. Turn your clutch right side out.
2. Either ladder stitch or topstitch the lining opening closed.
