Create an adorable halter apron with flounce details using our FREE pattern and beginner-friendly sewing instructions! 🍓

Our first free pattern for this summer is this adorable halter apron with a flounce hem! I apologize for the hiatus in May—I was away on a month-long vacation. This project is perfect for complete beginners and makes a great gift. It’s easy to make and sure to impress! 😊

For this project, you'll need to hem a round design (the flounce). I highly recommend using the [Clover Hot Hemmer](https://amzn.to/3L0yoI3). It allows you to fold, measure, and press hems in one easy step. Trust me, this tool will be a lifesaver!

You'll also need an **awl** to mark or create drill holes for pocket placements. Here's the [link](https://amzn.to/4bif1oE) to the one I use.
