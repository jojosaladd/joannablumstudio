<!-- ##### ðŸ’• Learn How to Only Print Your Size (Embedded Layers Version Only):

This pattern file has embedded layers (organized by size). If you don't want to print all sizes, you can choose to print only your size using Adobe Reader (FREE!):

1. Open in [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)
2. Menu -> View -> Show/Hide -> Side Panels -> Make sure **Layers** is checked.
3. Click on the **Layers** option on the side panel.
4. There will be an eye next to each layer in the pattern. Turn off (by clicking) all the layers you do not need. The **TEMPLATE** layer needs to remain on for all sizes.

*Note: In some instances (though not always), printing preparation may require 3-5 minutes, which is perfectly normal. If you prefer not to wait, feel free to use the version without embedded layers. -->

##### ðŸ’• Size Chart:

Apologies for the limited size options for this skirt. For future free patterns, I promise there will be more sizes available.

### Suggested Cutting Plans (60"):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/suggested_cutting.png" alt="suggested_cutting_ariel_skirt" style="width:550px;">

**Fabric Requirement**: 1.75 to 2 yards (60 inches wide), depending on the size. If you're new to sewing and not comfortable with laying/cutting pattern pieces, I recommend getting at least 2.5 to 3 yards for preparation.

**Tip**: When choosing fabric, **avoid narrower widths like 45 inches** â€”they simply won't accommodate the flare design, especially for larger sizes. Opt for wider fabrics, around 60 inches, to ensure you have enough room for cutting without any fitting issues.

## Sewing Instructions:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/1.png" alt="pattern-instruction-1" style="width:550px;">

### 1) Prepare Waistband

1. Apply fusible interfacing onto the wrong side of the front waistband (C) and back waistband (D) using a light steam iron.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/2.png" alt="pattern-instruction-2" style="width:550px;">

2. Align the front and back waistbands (C & D) with right sides facing each other. Stitch the side seam using a 1/2-inch wide straight stitch, then press the seam open.

4. Turn the piece right side out using either a tool like a loop turner or your hand. If needed, refer to this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/F-wm5y-j--c?si=M2rKuG8HkHOmb_V-) by Hipstitch Academy for assistance.

### 3) Overlock/Zigzag Seam Edge Treatment

1. Apply an overlock or zigzag stitch to the center back (CB) seam for the back skirts (B).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/9.png" alt="pattern-instruction-9" style="width:550px;">

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/10.png" alt="pattern-instruction-10" style="width:550px;">

### 4) Attaching Skirt (Sewing Side Seams)

1. Sew the front (A) and one of the back pieces (B) together using french seams. Start by placing the pieces with **WRONG sides** together, then pin them securely and stitch along the seams with a 3/8" seam allowance.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/11.png" alt="pattern-instruction-11" style="width:550px;">

2. Press the seam allowance to one side, and then trim it down by half.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/12.png" alt="pattern-instruction-12" style="width:550px;">

3. Turn the skirt inside out and press the side seams flat. Next, pin the side seams again, this time enclosing the raw edges inside the new seams. Stitch along the pinned seams with a 1/4" seam allowance, and press the seam allowances towards the back of the skirt.

4. Repeat the same process for the other side.

### 5) Attaching Waistband to the Skirt
1. Fold the waistband in half and fold up the seam allowance (1/2") on the bottom edge of the band. Keep the top edge raw.

2. Align the top edge of the waistband (C+D) with the notches to the waist of the skirt, with right sides together. Stitch with a 1/2-inch seam allowance.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/15.png" alt="pattern-instruction-15" style="width:550px;">

3. Press the seam allowance up towards the waistband.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/16.png" alt="pattern-instruction-16" style="width:550px;">

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/17.png" alt="pattern-instruction-17" style="width:550px;">

5. Stitch in the ditch along the waist seam.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/20.png" alt="pattern-instruction-20" style="width:550px;">

### 7) Inserting an Invisible Zipper

Note: Here's a helpful video [tutorial](https://youtu.be/NOJuX6doP2Y?si=yt_j9Zfik5Pe4yaN) demonstrating how to insert an invisible zipper into the back of a skirt.

1. Place the zipper face down on the right side of one of the center back (CB) seam edges. Secure in place with pins or fabric clips.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/23.png" alt="pattern-instruction-23" style="width:550px;">

2. Using an invisible zipper foot on your sewing machine, stitch the zipper tape to the fabric along the edge, starting from the top and sewing downwards. Sew as close to the zipper teeth as possible.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post17/24.png" alt="pattern-instruction-24" style="width:550px;">

3. Once one side of the zipper is attached, close the zipper and align the other side of the zipper tape with the remaining CB seam edge. Repeat steps 1 and 2.

4. To complete, stitch the remaining CB seam below the zipper (1/2" seam), starting from the bottom of the zipper and sewing downwards. Backstitch at the beginning and end to secure the seam. Press the seam open.

### 8) Sew Hem
1. Turn up hem by 1/2in and press. Repeat to enclose the raw edge inside the hem.
2. Stitch close to the folded edge.
