DIY your own stylish bucket hat for autumn with this easy-to-follow, beginner-friendly sewing pattern!ðŸ¤ 

Hello everyone!

I apologize for being MIA for so long. As some of you may know, I recently moved from Los Angeles to Upstate New York, and I plan to stay here for the next few years. Moving was tough, and adjusting to a new environment has been quite a challengeâ€”but here we are!

I'm excited to present a new pattern for this fall: a bucket hatðŸ¤ ðŸ¤ ! This is a fantastic project, especially if you're looking to use up fabric scraps. It only requires about 1/2 yard of fabric, making it perfect for small remnants you may have lying around.

I hope you enjoy this project!


Let's get started! Here is the free pattern for download!

6. Match the notch on Piece A (Top Circle) with Piece B (Side Panel), right sides together. For Piece B, use the narrower side. Stay stitch (baste) only at the notches, leaving about 3/4" (2cm) between each tack. You'll make about four small tacks in total.

7. Clip the edges of the Side Panel (B) to help ease it around the curve of Piece A (Top). Pin carefully.

2.  Place the outer hat and lining right sides together, matching up the seams. Pin around the brim, then sew with a 3/8" (1cm) seam allowance, leaving a 3-3 1/2" (7-9cm) opening for turning.

3.  Pull the hat through the gap opening so it is right side out. Gently shape and press the brim flat. Close the gap by either hand-stitching or topstitch around the outer edge of the brim, stitching 1/4" (0.6 cm) from the edge for a neat, finished look.
