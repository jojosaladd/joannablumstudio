### Part 2: Prepare the Bow Part

1. Fold fabric (B) in half lengthwise (right side together) and stitch with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance, but avoid stitching the sides‚Äîfocus on the lengthwise part.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/4.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-1" style="width:850px;">

2. Flip it and press well to flatten and refine its appearance.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/5.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-2" style="width:550px;">

3. Create 4-5 pleats in the middle using your finger, then pin them together.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/6.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-3" style="width:550px;">

4. Hand-stitch to secure the pleats in the middle.

5. Fold fabric (D) in half lengthwise (right side together).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/8.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-5" style="width:850px;">

6. Stitch all around with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance, leaving an opening of about 3‚Äù to facilitate flipping, preferably in the middle.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/9.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-6" style="width:550px;">

7. Trim the corners and flip it using the opening.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/10.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-7" style="width:1000px;">

8. Press well to flatten then top stitch the opening or use a ladder stitch by hand.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/11.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-8" style="width:550px;">

9. Fold fabric (C) in half lengthwise (right side together).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/12.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-9" style="width:800px;">

10. Stitch only the lengthwise part with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/13.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-10" style="width:550px;">

11. Flip it using a spaghetti turner or a similar tool for easy flipping.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/14.png" alt="preparing-bow-part-picture-11" style="width:550px;">

### Part 3: Attaching Bow to the Front Tote

1. Fold fabric (A-front piece) in half and mark the center front (CF). From the CF, measure 4 1/2‚Äù down, then mark the loop placement (on the right side of the fabric) - use an erasable pen or fabric marker pen.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/15.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-1" style="width:800px;">

2. Position one side of fabric (C) towards the top of (A-front piece) at the marked loop placement, then stitch with a 1/4‚Äù seam allowance

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/16.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-2" style="width:300px;">

3. Position pieces (B) and (D), determining the space needed for the loop. Ensure it is snug but not overly tight. In my case, I had to trim the loop piece (C) to 3 1/4‚Äù, including a 1/4‚Äù seam allowance for the next step.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/17.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-3" style="width:750px;">

4. Hand-stitch the bottom loop securely, ensuring a strong attachment.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/18.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-4" style="width:750px;">

5. Once the loop is secure, position pieces (B) and (D) into the loop. Place piece (B) 2 1/2‚Äù down from the top of (A).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/19.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-5" style="width:900px;">

6. Stay-stitch with a 1/4‚Äù seam allowance to firmly hold (B) in place on the sides of (A).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/20.png" alt="attaching-bow-part-picture-6" style="width:400px;">

### Part 4: Attaching Strap to the Tote

1. Position one of the strap pieces (E) 4‚Äù from the side of the A-front piece, ensuring that the top-stitched area is placed inside (with the folded area outside).
2. Stay-stitch securely at 1/4‚Äù. The handle should be oriented towards the bottom of the A-front piece.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/21.png" alt="attaching-straps-picture-1" style="width:700px;">

3. Once completed, repeat the same process for the A-back piece.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/22.png" alt="attaching-straps-picture-2" style="width:500px;">

### Part 5: Attaching Self Tote Pieces Together

1. With the A-front piece and back piece right sides together, stitch the sides and bottom with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry about the corners yet.
2. Once completed, press all the seams open.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/23.png" alt="attaching-tote-picture-1" style="width:500px;">

3. Align the corner piece so that the opened seams of the side and bottom meet at the center of this straight line. Stitch with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance. Repeat the process for the other corner.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/24.png" alt="attaching-tote-picture-2" style="width:600px;">


### Part 6: Attaching Lining Tote Pieces Together

1. With F (upper lining panel) and G (lower lining panel) right sides together, stitch with a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance.
2. Press the seam towards the upper panel, then top stitch.
3. (OPTIONAL) If you want to attach snap buttons, now is the time.
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/25.png" alt="attaching-tote-lining-picture-1" style="width:800px;">

4. Use the instructions in part 5 to attach the lining tote pieces together.

### Part 7: Attaching Everything Together

1. Insert the Lining Pieces inside the Exterior Pieces with right sides together. Line up side seams.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/26.png" alt="attaching-tote-final-picture-1" style="width:300px;">

2. Pin in place and repeat on the opposite side of the bag. **BE SURE TO LEAVE A 3‚Äù OPENING FOR TURNING YOUR BAG, preferably at the CB area.**
3. Using a 3/8‚Äù seam allowance, stitch around the top edge of your bag.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post11/27.png" alt="attaching-tote-final-picture-2" style="width:600px;">


### Part 8: Finishing Up

2. Top stitch around the entire top of the bag.
