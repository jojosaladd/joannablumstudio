This pattern file has embedded layers (organized by size). If you don't want to print all sizes, you can choose to print only your size using Adobe Reader (FREE!):

1. Open in [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)
2. Menu -> View -> Show/Hide -> Side Panels -> Make sure **Layers** is checked.
3. Click on the **Layers** option on the side panel.
4. There will be an eye next to each layer in the pattern. Turn off (by clicking) all the layers you do not need. The **DO NOT TOUCH** layer needs to remain on for all sizes.
